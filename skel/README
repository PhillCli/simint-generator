Simint
----------------------------------------------------
Horizontally-vectorized electron repulsion integrals


----------
WARNING
----------
This is still a somewhat experimental library.
I've validated it as much as possible, but there still may be bugs. In addition,
the API may change in the future.

----------
WARNING 2
----------
This currently supports only up to (g g | g g) integrals.
Any permutation of angular momentum *is* supported


-------------
Requirements
-------------

Intel Compiler v15 or above
CMake 3.0.2 or above
Intel CPU



---------------------------
Selecting the right library
---------------------------

There are currently three verions. Make sure you select
the correct one for you CPU

1.) simint-avxfma
    Intel CPUs with AVX and FMA support
      * Haswell

2.) simint-avx
    Intel CPUs with AVX support
      * Sandy Bridge (not tested)
      * Ivy Bridge
      * Haswell

3.) simint-sse
    Intel CPUs with SSSE3 support
      * Basically any CPU make in the last 10 years

4.) simint-scalar
    Should work with basically any CPU, but isn't vectorized...



---------------------------
Configuring
---------------------------

Configuration and building is done via CMake (www.cmake.org).
Generally, from within the extracted directory:

    mkdir build; cd build
    CC=icc CXX=icpc cmake (...other options...)  ../

Other options (besides CMake standard options):

    -DSIMINT_BUILD_SHARED:Bool=True
        Build shared library, rather than a static library (default is static library)


    -DSIMINT_TESTS_CXX_FLAGS="flag1;flag2"
    -DSIMINT_C_FLAGS="flag1;flag2"

        Additional flags to pass to Simint, separated by semicolon. For example,
            -DSIMINT_C_FLAGS="-no-vec;-no-simd"           disable compiler-generated vectorization
            -DSIMINT_TESTS_CXX_FLAGS="-no-vec;-no-simd"   disable compiler-generated vectorization
   

---------------------------
Building
---------------------------

make and make install, as usual


---------------------------
Tests
---------------------------

Can run tests from the build directory. See tests/dat for available
molecules and basis sets.


    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 test_eri           - Validate accuracy
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 benchmark_eri      - Benchmark simint 

You can of course change the number of threads to whatever you want. By default,
it will use all available threads/cores.

Examples (run from the build directory):

    OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 test/test_eri ../test/dat/H2O.STO-3G.mol
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 test/test_eri ../test/dat/ETHANE.AUG-CC-PVTZ.mol
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 test/benchmark_eri ../test/dat/C6H6.ANO.mol



---------------------------
Code examples
---------------------------

Some simple examples of using the library are in the "examples" subdirectory.
They are built by default.
